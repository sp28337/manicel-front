# Manicel Frontend — Next.js Application

🌐 **Production:** https://manicel.ru/


This repository contains the frontend part of my first production web project, built with **Next.js** and **React**.  
It was my first experience with frontend development and deploying a application to production.

During development, I worked with **Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript**. I also gained hands-on experience with project structure in Next.js, environment configuration, linting, and preparing the application for a production build.

This project became my entry point into frontend development and laid the foundation for my further work with **React, Next.js, and fullstack applications**.
